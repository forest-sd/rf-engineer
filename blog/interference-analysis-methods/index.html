<p>RF interference is one of the most persistent and costly problems in wireless system engineering. Whether you are deploying a new cellular network, designing a public safety communications system, or bringing an IoT product to market, interference has the potential to degrade link margins, increase error rates, and ultimately render a system inoperable. A systematic, methodical approach to interference analysis — beginning long before deployment — is the most effective way to protect system performance and avoid expensive remediation work in the field.</p>

<h2>Classifying Interference: Understanding What You Are Dealing With</h2>

<p>Effective interference mitigation starts with accurate classification. Interference arrives through several distinct mechanisms, and the correct mitigation strategy depends entirely on which mechanism is at work.</p>

<p><strong>Co-channel interference (CCI)</strong> occurs when two transmitters operate on exactly the same frequency. In cellular networks, the carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I) must typically exceed 9 dB for CDMA systems and 12–18 dB for TDMA/GSM to maintain acceptable voice quality. LTE and 5G NR systems have higher requirements: a minimum SINR of around −3 dB is needed for the lowest modulation scheme (QPSK, code rate 1/8), while 256-QAM requires SINR above 22 dB. When C/I margins are insufficient, either the desired signal must be boosted, or the interferer must be attenuated.</p>

<p><strong>Adjacent channel interference (ACI)</strong> results from transmitter spectral regrowth and receiver filter roll-off imperfections. A PA operating at or near saturation can generate spectral splatter 30–50 dB below the carrier that still exceeds adjacent-channel receiver noise floors. Adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) specifications — commonly −45 dBc or better for LTE base stations — exist precisely to control this mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Intermodulation interference</strong> arises when two or more signals mix in a nonlinear device to produce new frequencies. Third-order intermodulation products (IM3) at 2f₁ − f₂ and 2f₂ − f₁ are often the most problematic because they fall near the original carriers. If two transmitters at 850 MHz and 855 MHz share a passive combining network with inadequate isolation, their IM3 products appear at 845 MHz and 860 MHz — directly in adjacent channels.</p>

<p><strong>Spurious emissions</strong> include harmonics, oscillator leakage, and switching noise. A 2.4 GHz WLAN transmitter's second harmonic at 4.8 GHz can desensitize receivers in the 4.9 GHz public safety band. Unintentional radiators — switching power supplies, motor drive controllers, LED drivers — generate broadband noise floors that can raise the noise figure of a sensitive receiver by several dB.</p>

<h2>Spectrum Analysis: The Cornerstone of Interference Investigation</h2>

<p>A spectrum analyzer is the primary instrument for interference characterization. Modern swept-tuned and FFT-based analyzers offer dynamic ranges exceeding 100 dB, making it possible to detect weak interferers that would otherwise go unnoticed. Key measurement parameters to set correctly include:</p>

<p><strong>Resolution bandwidth (RBW):</strong> A narrower RBW lowers the noise floor by approximately 10 dB per decade of bandwidth reduction, enabling detection of low-level narrowband signals buried in the noise. For wideband interference hunting, a wider RBW (100 kHz to 1 MHz) provides faster sweep rates and better visualization of broadband sources.</p>

<p><strong>Detector mode:</strong> Peak detection captures intermittent signals that a sample detector would miss. Average detection better represents continuous broadband noise. RMS detection gives the power-accurate result for modulated signals. Using the wrong detector mode is one of the most common sources of measurement error in interference investigations.</p>

<p><strong>Reference level and input attenuation:</strong> Setting the reference level too high increases internal noise floor; setting it too low risks overdriving the front end and generating internal intermodulation that can be mistaken for external interference. A good practice is to set the input attenuator so that the strongest signal in the band is 10–20 dB below the reference level.</p>

<p>For site surveys, a calibrated directional antenna (a log-periodic or Yagi with known gain) connected to the spectrum analyzer enables direction finding. Rotating the antenna while observing signal strength allows the engineer to triangulate the source to within a few degrees of azimuth, which combined with distance estimation from signal level enables localization to within tens of meters in many scenarios.</p>

<h2>Predictive Interference Modeling</h2>

<p>Pre-deployment interference analysis saves far more money than field troubleshooting. The process begins with a complete inventory of all transmitters and receivers in or near the planned deployment area, including frequencies, power levels, antenna types, heights, and orientations. This information feeds propagation calculations that estimate received interference levels at each receiver location.</p>

<p>The basic interference calculation follows from the link budget: received interference power (dBm) = transmit power (dBm) + transmit antenna gain (dBi) − path loss (dB) + receive antenna gain (dBi). Path loss at 900 MHz over 1 km in urban terrain is approximately 120–140 dB depending on the model used. At 2.4 GHz, path loss increases by roughly 8.5 dB for the same geometry. These numbers translate directly into protection ratios needed.</p>

<p>Frequency coordination databases — such as those maintained by the FCC, NTIA, and private frequency coordinators — provide registered interference information for licensed services. Cross-referencing planned frequencies against these databases during the design phase is mandatory for avoiding conflicts with incumbents. In the 900 MHz ISM band, however, no coordination is required, meaning spectrum monitoring is the only way to characterize the actual interference environment.</p>

<h2>Intermodulation Analysis: Calculating IM Products</h2>

<p>Intermodulation analysis requires a complete frequency list of all transmitters that might enter any nonlinear element in the system. The IM3 product frequencies can be computed as:</p>

<p style="margin-left:2em">f<sub>IM3</sub> = 2f<sub>A</sub> − f<sub>B</sub> &nbsp; or &nbsp; 2f<sub>B</sub> − f<sub>A</sub></p>

<p>For IM5 products: f<sub>IM5</sub> = 3f<sub>A</sub> − 2f<sub>B</sub>, and so on for higher orders. Although higher-order products are progressively weaker — IM5 is typically 20 dB below IM3 for a given input level — they should not be neglected when many transmitters are co-located.</p>

<p>A practical example: a public safety site with transmitters at 460.100 MHz and 460.200 MHz will produce IM3 products at 460.000 MHz and 460.300 MHz. If a receive channel sits at 460.000 MHz, the IM3 product falls directly on top of it. The fix might involve retuning one transmitter by 50 kHz — shifting the IM3 product outside the receive passband — or installing a high-isolation hybrid combiner to reduce the signal level at nonlinear junctions by 20–30 dB.</p>

<p>Passive intermodulation (PIM) is a related problem unique to high-power transmit systems. Ferromagnetic materials (certain grades of steel hardware, rust), loose connectors, and carbon-contaminated contacts can generate IM products even without active amplifiers. PIM products at the receiver input can be −140 dBc or worse relative to a 2×43 dBm (2×20 W) stimulus, equivalent to −97 dBm — which is above the noise floor of most cellular base station receivers. PIM testing to IEC 62037 uses two 20 W carriers and measures IM products down to −150 dBc.</p>

<h2>Mitigation Strategies: Selecting the Right Tool</h2>

<p><strong>Filtering:</strong> Bandpass and notch filters are the most straightforward mitigation for out-of-band interference. A cavity bandpass filter with a bandwidth of 5 MHz centered on a 450 MHz receive frequency can provide 60–80 dB of rejection at 10 MHz offset. The trade-off is insertion loss (typically 0.5–2 dB) that directly degrades receiver noise figure. For receive-only applications, a low-noise amplifier ahead of the filter can recover the noise figure penalty while maintaining interference rejection.</p>

<p><strong>Shielding:</strong> RF shielding attenuates interference through reflection and absorption. A solid copper enclosure 1 mm thick provides over 100 dB of shielding effectiveness at 1 GHz. Practical shielding implementations — enclosures with seams, ventilation holes, and cable penetrations — achieve 40–80 dB. The critical parameter is the size of the largest aperture: any opening larger than λ/20 begins to compromise shielding effectiveness significantly.</p>

<p><strong>Frequency coordination:</strong> In congested spectrum environments, frequency coordination through a third-party coordinator or regulatory database is the systematic approach to avoiding co-channel conflicts. Coordination typically reserves a minimum frequency separation based on propagation analysis and system bandwidths. For critical infrastructure, a protection ratio of 20 dB above the interferer's predicted level at the victim receiver is a common planning criterion.</p>

<p><strong>Spatial separation:</strong> Increasing the distance between an interferer and a victim receiver is often the most practical solution. Every doubling of distance adds approximately 6 dB of attenuation in free space and 20–40 dB in cluttered environments depending on frequency. Antenna orientation can add another 20–30 dB through front-to-back ratio optimization, effectively achieving the same result as moving the receiver further away.</p>

<p><strong>Time-domain coordination:</strong> For systems using TDMA or TDD architectures, interference can sometimes be avoided by time-aligning transmit and receive slots so that a nearby transmitter is silent during the critical receive window. This technique is common in TDD-LTE and 802.11 deployments where timing can be synchronized.</p>

<h2>Continuous Monitoring Systems</h2>

<p>The RF environment is not static. New transmitters are deployed, equipment ages and develops spurious emissions, and conditions change with weather and seasonal vegetation. A continuous monitoring system provides early warning of emerging interference before it impacts service quality.</p>

<p>Modern RF monitoring systems use software-defined radio (SDR) receivers with FFT engines capable of scanning 100 MHz or more of bandwidth every second. Triggered recording captures the full waveform of intermittent events for post-capture analysis. Distributed sensors — multiple receivers at different geographic locations — enable time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) localization of interference sources to within a few hundred meters.</p>

<p>Setting appropriate alarm thresholds is critical: too sensitive and nuisance alarms overwhelm the operations team; too conservative and real interference events go undetected. A practical approach is to establish a baseline spectrum occupancy map during a quiet period, then alarm on any new signal exceeding the baseline by more than 10–15 dB in a channel of interest.</p>

<h2>Case Examples</h2>

<p><strong>Case 1 — LTE uplink desensitization:</strong> An LTE operator deploying a new sector at 700 MHz found uplink throughput 40% below plan. Spectrum analysis at the base station antenna port showed a broadband noise rise of 8 dB beginning at 716 MHz. The source was traced to a co-located television broadcast transmitter at 710 MHz whose PA amplifier had a faulty bias network generating spectral regrowth extending 20 MHz above the carrier. Installing a 5-cavity bandpass filter at the LTE receive port provided 55 dB of rejection at 710 MHz and restored normal uplink performance. The filter's 0.8 dB insertion loss was acceptable given the 8 dB noise problem it solved.</p>

<p><strong>Case 2 — PIM on a rooftop site:</strong> A new 2×20 W LTE carrier at 1900 MHz caused the existing 850 MHz receive path to fail its noise figure specification by 6 dB. PIM testing at 1900 MHz revealed IM3 products at 850 MHz measuring −118 dBc — 22 dB worse than the −140 dBc IEC 62037 specification. Visual inspection found a rusted N-type connector on the 1900 MHz feeder that had been overlooked during installation. Replacing the connector and cleaning the mating surface reduced PIM by 28 dB, bringing the IM3 product to −146 dBc and restoring the 850 MHz receiver sensitivity.</p>

<p>These examples illustrate the importance of systematic investigation rather than assumptions. In both cases, the root cause was a hardware defect discoverable only through careful measurement. Interference analysis is ultimately a process of elimination guided by data — the engineer who measures more, guesses less.</p>
